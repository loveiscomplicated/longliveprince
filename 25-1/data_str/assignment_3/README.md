### Understanding the Code Structure
If you find it hard to understand the structure of the provided code, be sure to **check the comments** for each function!
Many IDEs will show these comments when you hover your cursor over the function name.

### Note on LargeRandom Test Case
The `LargeRandom` test cases will only pass if your AVL tree implementation is correct.
Passing all `LargeRandom` test cases means you've achieved a perfect score!

### Coding Style
All provided C++ files (`.h`, `.cc`) have been formatted using `clang-format`.
You are encouraged to maintain a consistent coding style.

## Good luck! üçÄ
